Heroes-of-Pymoli

Heroes-Of-Pymoli is a fictional study about a fictional game. This data has been analyzed to show purchasing trends based on age, gender, profit, popularity and top spenders

From this data I have found-
Men ages 20-24 make up the largest percentage of players

Final Critic has been purchased the most and has also made the most money. It is not the most expensive

Firey Glass Crusader is the third most profitable but the fourth in purchases
